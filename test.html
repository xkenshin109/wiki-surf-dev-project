Niyama (Sanskrit: ????) are positive duties or observances. In Indian traditions, particularly Yoga, niyamas and its complement, Yamas, are recommended activities and habits for healthy living, spiritual enlightenment and liberated state of existence. It has multiple meanings depending on context in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the term extends to the determinations of nature, as in the Buddhist niyama dhammas.\n\n\n== Hinduism ==\nVirtues are extensively discussed in various ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism. In its Yoga school, they are described in first two of eight limbs (steps, branches, components). The first limb is called yamas, which include virtuous self-restraints (the \"don'ts\"). The second limb is called niyamas which include virtuous habits, behaviors and observances (the \"dos\"). These virtues and ethical premises are considered in Hinduism as necessary for an individual to achieve a self-realized, enlightened, liberated state of existence (moksha).\n\n\n=== Five Niyamas ===\nIn Patanjali's <a href=\"javascript:userClicked('Yoga Sutra','53f8f4f3-7ecf-4346-95b7-a5263be132cd')\"><span>Yoga Sutra</span></a>s, the Niyamas are the second limb of the eight limbs of Yoga.
